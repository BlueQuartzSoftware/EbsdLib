To determine if the directions \([10\bar{1}0]\) and \([01\bar{1}0]\) are symmetrically equivalent in a **Trigonal \(-3m\)** crystal symmetry, we need to apply the symmetry operations of the **\(-3m\)** point group. These operations include 120° and 240° rotations, mirror reflections, and inversion.

### Directions in Miller Indices:
- **Direction 1**: \([10\bar{1}0]\)
- **Direction 2**: \([01\bar{1}0]\)

These are both directions in the hexagonal (a-b) plane, which means we will apply symmetry operations that involve transformations within this plane.

### Step 1: Apply the 120° and 240° Rotations

#### 120° Rotation Around the \(c\)-axis
In the Trigonal \(-3m\) symmetry group, the 120° rotation around the \(c\)-axis permutes the in-plane directions. The general transformation for a 120° rotation in the hexagonal system is:
\[
[h k i l] \xrightarrow{\text{120°}} [k \, -h-k \, h \, l]
\]

Applying this to the first direction \([10\bar{1}0]\):
\[
[10\bar{1}0] \xrightarrow{\text{120°}} [0 \, -1 \, 1 \, 0] = [01\bar{1}0]
\]

After applying the 120° rotation, the direction \([10\bar{1}0]\) becomes \([01\bar{1}0]\), which is the same as **Direction 2**. Therefore, the two directions are **symmetrically equivalent** under the 120° rotation around the \(c\)-axis.

#### 240° Rotation Around the \(c\)-axis
For completeness, let's also check the 240° rotation. The transformation for a 240° rotation in the hexagonal system is:
\[
[h k i l] \xrightarrow{\text{240°}} [-h-k \, h \, k \, l]
\]

Applying this to \([10\bar{1}0]\):
\[
[10\bar{1}0] \xrightarrow{\text{240°}} [-1 \, 1 \, 0 \, 0] = [\bar{1}10]
\]

This does not give us \([01\bar{1}0]\), so the 240° rotation does not result in the equivalence.

### Step 2: Apply the Mirror Reflection

The mirror planes in the \(-3m\) group typically involve reflections in planes containing the \(c\)-axis. A reflection across a plane that contains the \(c\)-axis but reflects in the hexagonal plane (a-b) could change the direction indices. However, in this case, we already know that a 120° rotation gave us symmetry equivalence.

### Step 3: Conclusion
Since applying a **120° rotation** to \([10\bar{1}0]\) yields \([01\bar{1}0]\), we can conclude that the two directions are **symmetrically equivalent** under the Trigonal \(-3m\) crystal symmetry.

Thus, \([10\bar{1}0]\) and \([01\bar{1}0]\) are symmetrically equivalent in the **Trigonal \(-3m\)** system due to the 120° rotational symmetry about the \(c\)-axis.
